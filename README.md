Fitopia is a transformative web application that revolutionises how users access fitness studios and classes. Fitness studios can list their own classes and activities on Fitopia. Customers are able to book any classes or activities offered by the different fitness studios through Fitopia. This allows customers to attend classes provided by different studios without the former needing to sign an exclusive membership with them. Through this, Fitopia aims to bridge the gap between fitness lovers and studios, making it easier and more convenient to discover and schedule fitness sessions. This not only provides users with a greater choice of workouts but also supports local fitness businesses by increasing their visibility and accessibility. Fitopia's impact extends beyond convenience, fostering a sense of community among users and promoting a healthier, more active lifestyle.
